NOTE TO ABEL:
    Please the pages folder is for non-reusable components;
    And also fetch/pull first so we dont get conflicts
    also you should create and a branch everytime you want to start another page so we merge tHEM TOGETHER LATER

        The homepage is only perfectly responsive up till 860px;
        Created components(button,card);

        Added some little responsiveness to the footer;
        added the header image for the about-us page


Date (11/03/2022) NOTE TO ABEL:
        I've built the coursespage, resources page and people's/staff's homepage;
        I've also built resources accordion and it's functionality;
        ðŸ‘‹ðŸ™‚I've still got to build each staff's page(totalling 8 pages and also fix responsiveness);

        I've built a project-item component for you ;
        All you have build now is the projects page,and the pages for each project (totalling 4 pages),with the contact-us page;
